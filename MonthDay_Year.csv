"1,935",Please help support Avery during chemo,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,40,"My son Avery was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia on April 25th,
  2019 after a 6 day hospital stay. We have currently been in the
  hospital for 15 days and have at least 3 more weeks to go followed by
  a few days at home and more 28 day cycles in the hospital. During this
  time I have been with Avery 23 hours a day and haven’t been working
  while he receives chemo. I hate asking for help but during this
  process I need to lean on my village. Anything will help keep me here
  with Avery while we go through what is probably the hardest time in
  our life.",https://fundrazr.com/51UuZ5
680,Help Bre #keepmoving & maintain their independence with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,"Aug 6, 2019",of $2.8k goal,14,"Hey friends! Okay, so... I'm Bre. I'm 28 years old. I'm a lover of the
    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,
      open up my world again, and change my life. Thank you for your consideration and support ♥",https://fundrazr.com/f1VtI8
"1,847,335",American Gut,,,,,"The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with
    the goal of collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data
    from populations across the globe. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is
    simple! Select the kit you would like from the list of options on
    the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if you would like
    to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed as a perk,
    email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes approximately significantly
      longer (5+ months) to receive results if you submit one of the
      following sample types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be

"32,454",Helping Heidi with Cancer Treatments,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,218,"For those that don’t know me I’m Heidi! For everyone else, Hi! And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't
    cheap. GBM is like a needy, expensive house guest that doesn't know
    when to leave. If you feel compelled to donate, we appreciate your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/pbandcancer
"3,181",Judy Gerdis Needs Costly Oral Chemo for Metastatic Breast Cancer,U.S. Dollar,"Aug 17, 2019",of $9k goal,35,"Hello, I am Tom and Judy Gerdis’ daughter, Trina Sutherland.
     Some of you may be aware in April of this year my mother, Judy, was
    told by her physicians that the breast cancer she fought hard to rid
    her body of in 2008 through 2009 has returned and is attacking her
    bones.  It is currently on a femur, in her tailbone,  shoulder,
    neck, some parts of the spine, and her lower skull. We were excited
    to learn through scans none of her organs have been affected. And we
    want to keep it that way! She began a 10 day treatment of radiation two weeks ago. Now she is
  waiting for her white blood cell count to recover so she may begin the
  oral chemo treatment called Ibrance. Ibrance is a very costly
  prescription. After insurance, it costs $2235.00 for a 21 day supply.
  This prescription could possibly need to be administered for the next
  year. I hope that we can all rally around my parents at this time so
  they will not have to refinance their home in order to pay for this
  lifesaving medicine. The cost of this one drug for a year is  close to
  $30,000. The first month is covered and then we have 30 days to band
  together before the bills hit for each new month’s prescription.  This
  is not including her other medications and treatments. My mom is determined to win this battle once more. Tom and Judy are
  confident the Lord is walking her through this journey  and the
  Father’s amazing healing works will be demonstrated mightily. Thank you for your donations and prayers! Every little bit will help
  my mom continue to fight the good fight. Please follow this page at
  the bottom to keep up with updates. If Ibrance is discontinued,
   whatever monies are raised will go to any other medical expenses my
  parents may incur.   Blessings!",https://fundrazr.com/f1VFVf
355,Help James get something off their chest!,U.S. Dollar,,of $8k goal,10,"About me: I’m a passionate animal lover from Roanoke,
  VA working at a nonprofit animal welfare organization in the
  Shenandoah Valley (yep, the same one the sad song is about). I was
  privileged as a young adult to spend time in safe spaces, and I found
  the latitude to question my gender. While I was described as a tomboy
  in my childhood, there is perhaps more to the story as an adult. The Challenge: I am deeply rooted to nonprofits and
  cause-based work, leaving little time and energy left towards pure
  capital gain. That said, over my years of questioning, researching,
  listening to trans people’s personal journeys, and amplifying voices
  where and when I can, surgery is going to be part of my transition to
  greater comfort in my own body and my own skin. While I find it
  difficult to put into language the nuance of how I feel in my body,
  the long and short of it is that I’m very uncomfortable with some of
  its features that cannot be the shape I feel they should without top surgery. The Goal: The purpose of this fundraiser is to raise
  money to pay for my top surgery. Donations will go directly to getting
  something off my chest so I can continue my work in the nonprofit
  sector with animals who have no voice otherwise. I humbly ask for your consideration among
  so many other worthy causes. A few dollars, a few cents, is deeply
  appreciated! Every contribution counts! No donation is too small!",https://fundrazr.com/boobsbegone
"5,460",Miles Turns Two,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,48,"Miles was born at 9:35PM on June 8, 2017 at Advocate Lutheran General
  Hospital, and it was quickly discovered that something wasn't quite
  right. Miles was gasping for air and showing signs of seizures, and he
  was almost immediately whisked away to the NICU for what would be his
  home for months to come. After four, long days of tests, x-rays, and
  more pokes than one newborn should ever have to endure, it was
  discovered that Miles's ALP levels were ""immeasurable"" and
  many of his bones were so under-mineralized, that they didn't even
  show up on x-ray. While we didn't have genetic confirmation at this
  point (that would come a few weeks later), Miles was diagnosed with
  Infantile Hypophosphatasia - or HPP for short. With his essentially
  nonexistent ALP, Miles is unable to mineralize bones properly. His
  body also struggles with breaking down B6, which cause him to suffer
  from B6 responsive seizures. Thankfully for Miles and the rest of us,
  there is an enzyme replacement therapy that was recently approved by
  the FDA. Miles received his first injection on June 23. It took about two months to start to see some development in Miles's
  bones. His skull that was referred to as ""bone buds"" when he
  was born was finally starting to mineralize. His ribs that looked like
  toothpicks on the first x-ray were showing some strength. We had no
  idea for these first couple of months if the enzyme replacement
  therapy would work. And these x-rays were the first real sign of hope
  because by the end of July, Miles had tired himself out from his
  short, shallow breathing and found himself intubated. After much
  discussion with his doctors, Miles had surgery to get his trach and
  g-tube on August 9. Now you'd think that with a ventilator helping him breathe and the
  enzyme replacement therapy helping him mineralize his bones, we would
  have started to see marked improvement in Miles. But that wasn't the
  case. Miles continued to struggle. Growing bones is apparently quite
  painful (I mean even the great Harry Potter thought so). After some
  advocating by his wonderful nurses, Miles was given a morphine drip
  for the pain. He was also on a number of sedative drugs. It took until
  November, at over 5 months old, for Miles to be weaned off of his IV
  drips and have his central line removed. Even after his central line
  was removed, it took until December for him to be weaned completely
  off of morphine. And on January 16, 2018, after 222 days in the NICU, Miles was
  finally stable enough to come home. But this wasn't the end of Miles's
  medical adventures. Miles came home 100% ventilator and oxygen
  dependent. He also was fed entirely through a g-tube and never took a bottle. For the past year and a half, Miles has made major strides. He's
  learned to sit unassisted, to crawl, and even bear weight on his once
  broken legs. He's grown strong enough to start weaning off the vent.
  And he's begun taking some food by mouth. But Miles still has a
  lifetime of obstacles to overcome thanks to his HPP. For Miles's second birthday, we are raising money for Soft Bones.
  Soft Bones is an amazing organization that has helped us so much in
  Miles's first two years of life. They offer support and resources to
  HPP patients and families. They fund research to help better the lives
  of patients with HPP, and hopefully to one day fine a cure for HPP. We
  are honored to give back to this organization that has given us so much. For more information on HPP or Soft Bones, visit SoftBones.org",https://fundrazr.com/milesturnstwo

"5,620",Kidney for Bryanna,U.S. Dollar,"Jul 1, 2019",of $5k goal,58,"My daughter, Bryanna, needs a kidney. She is 19 years old and is one
  of the hardest working, loving and hilarious young Christian woman I
  have known. Unfortunately, while she was a junior in high school, it
  was discovered that her kidneys were failing. She was diagnosed with FSGS, which causes scarring in the tiny
  filters in her kidneys, rendering them useless. Several medications
  were used in an attempt to slow the progress of the disease but her
  body did not respond.  This past November she had a dialysis catheter
  placed and started dialysis. She does her dialysis at home and has so
  much responsibility between her daily 14 hour dialysis routine, many
  medications, strict diet and weekly clinic appointments. As her health
  declined, she has maintained a part time job and has taken classes at
  community college as she wants to become a registered nurse. She has
  nowhere near the stamina a 19 year old should have but she pushes
  herself so hard. Wait time for a type O kidney in Michigan is 5-5 1/2 years. As a
  parent it is gut wrenching to watch her suffer the fatigue, constant
  nausea, and occasional depression. A suitable live donor has not been
  found. Fort Worth, Texas currently has the shortest wait time in the
  nation at less than a year is estimated. As a result, we are uprooting
  our family and moving to Texas in order to have her listed there. We will be starting over with new insurance deductibles and, due to
  moving expenses, paying her medical costs will be very difficult.
  Please consider donating in order to offset the medical costs for her
  current treatment and help us prepare for a transplant. All donations
  will be kept in a separate account for her medical bills. Ability to
  afford medical expenses (such as post transplant anti-rejection
  medications) is necessary in order to be listed for transplant. We appreciate all support, whether it is monetary, a prayer or a word
  of encouragement. Please be sure to consider becoming a registered
  organ donor and be sure your family is aware of your wishes. There are
  so many people like Bryanna who are waiting. Thank you so much for reading this and for caring.",https://fundrazr.com/11Ugn5
"691,066",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and analyzed. We estimate that the whole process will take about 4-5
  months. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab every 1-2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once your
  sample is arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), it takes approximately 3 months to
  return results. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,

  help. She has asked me to help her raise money as her medical expenses
  and medication expenses have wiped us out.  As most of you know she is
  fighting cancer and the financial burden is real. My sweet mom is 79
  years young and has been through so much. On top of all this , she has
  lost her home. She sold her household items trying to hold on to her
  house and pay for medical bills, but it wasn't enough to keep the bank
  away. She's asked me to help her with her mounting medical expenses. 
  Please, help ease our financial pressure, so she can concentrate on

"15,194",Help Rich Reach the Finish Line,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,104,"**Please note: Medical bills have already depleted the $12,369 that
  was raised over the past 4 years. ** In December of 2018, Rich learned that his Mantle Cell Lymphoma had
  returned. It was hard to receive this news before Christmas, but love
  for his family compelled him to continue his journey to being
  cancer-free. In January he began a 3 month treatment of Venetoclax,
  hoping the drug that worked so powerfully 2 years ago would bring him
  into remission again. Instead, his disease spread exponentially. While still mid-course in the Venetoclax treatment, we
  discovered that I, Rich’s sister, Janice, am a perfect 10/10 match for
  an allogenic stem cell transplant! A matched sibling donor is
  considered the “gold standard” for successful stem cell transplants.
  The answer to our prayers came at the perfect time! An allogenic stem
  cell transplant is the only potentially curative therapy for MCL On April 19, Rich began his 5th course of treatment in his 4 year
  cancer marathon. We are beyond thankful that he is now in remission
  and on track for an allogenic transplant at the end of June. After the
  transplant, Rich is not expected to be discharged back to his home

"33,799",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,589,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
140,Help Mel's Road to Recovery,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 30, 2019",of $18k goal,3,"My name is Melanie and THANK YOU for visiting my page! I am raising
  money to alleviate a portion of the financial stress that comes with
  having thousands of dollars worth of medical debt as a college student. In 2015, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder which has been with
  me since 2008. Eating disorders affect over 30 million people in the
  United States, and after a long period of denial, I recognize that I
  am one of those people, and that my life is at stake if I continue.
  Starting with the diagnosis in 2015, I have begun to seek recovery. Unfortunately, my first stay in residential treatment was not as
  effective as I'd hoped, in part because it was cut short due to
  financial stress and lack of adequate insurance coverage. Though there
  have been periods of decreased symptom-use while seeing an outpatient
  therapist, my health has continued to decline as symptoms have
  continued, especially with new stresses being introduced without the
  tools to manage depression and anxiety symptoms. This time around, things are vastly different. I've grown a lot, been able to keep a job as a Nurse's Aid where I
  love taking care of the elders and bonding with them. However, I've
  had to step away from that for the time being in order to give
  recovery a real chance, so that I can not only be out of the woods
  medically, but move on to the rest of my life as a healthy individual
  with a healthy relationship with others, starting with myself. As of Monday, June 10th, I will be admitted to Magnolia Creek's
  residential program just outside Birmingham, Alabama.  I know that I
  need this level of care to get myself to a healthy place, whatever the
  cost. However, it is not a cheap decision. Any help whether in prayers
  or in finances would be graciously received. I've been blessed with amazing, encouraging friends and coworkers as
  well as an adorable, faithful dog. If you would consider even giving a
  small contribution to this cause, my appreciation would be
  unfathomable, and you would quite literally be my hero. I thank you in
  advance for your kindness and generosity, and may God bless.",https://fundrazr.com/melsroadtorecovery

"8,988",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,"Jan 2, 2020",of $50k goal,72,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and
  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed
  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,
  strong young man it is greatly appreciated. All funds raised will be

  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.

"1,268",Bone Tumor Awareness Fund,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,29,"Hello family, friends, and supporters!  I am a 33-year old survivor
  of an extremely rare bone tumor (desmoplastic fibroma), and have
  decided to embark on a journey to create more awareness and provide
  funding for more research for these rare tumors to help physicians and
  patients better understand these conditions, procedures, and treatment/recovery. I am currently recovering after undergoing a more aggressive/radical
  treatment after a 2nd recurrence of this tumor (in my right femur, as
  pictured) to replace my knee as well as half of the femur - the
  typical treatment for malignant osteasarcoma (my 5th operation in
  total).  This is pretty much a testament to how aggressive and
  grueling these tumors are, whether they are benign or not - that the
  treatment is similar or can be identical to that of a cancerous growth
  of the bone. These tumors happen in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life; therefore,
  the majority of individuals enduring this pain, multiple operations,
  and lengthy recoveries are in their childhood, teens, 20's and 30's.
   These are ages that are supposed to be the most active, fun, and
  joyful for youngsters and able-bodied people to be exercising, playing
  sports, etc.  Surgeries can be extremely invasive, painful, and
  continual. My goal is to create more awareness of these tumors that are vary
  rare (they make up approximately 2% of all tumors) and there are only
  about 120-200 orthopedic oncologists in the United States able to
  treat these rare growths.  Not to mention, in major cities and
  teaching institutions, rather than equally spread throughout - making
  it difficult for some patients to travel to see exactly who they need
  to see. I'd like to be able to create a community where survivors of
  these tumors can share their experiences with one another and provide
  support, as well as to start a fund that will benefit research toward
  a particular body of medical science that will be dedicated to
  learning more about muskuloskeletal lesions/tumors. For more information about bone tumors, please visit www.bonetumor.org . EVERY dollar counts.  Many
  perks are available to select with a donation. PLEASE like us on Facebook, www.facebook.com/bonetumorawareness, and/or

    donations that he had received from all over the world and he just
    could not believe the support he was receiving! Thanks so much, to everyone who has come forward so far to
    make life more wonderful for Nakula. Nakulas Story He has been suffering from severe PTSD for the past few years
    and he has just recently started taking high-quality CBD, and
    medications. He is receiving Hypnotherapy and professional medical
    attention and his condition is improving, yet in order for him to
    continue receiving the care he needs and
    professional psychological counseling on a consistent basis, we will
    need some help financially to cover all his medical expenses! He has started seeing a psychologist once a week in his house
    for PTSD symptoms which are pretty severe, because he could not make
    it into town for weekly visits, a house has been set up for him in
    the countryside where he has a volunteer working and living with him
    full time that is similar to a big brother mentoring situation. He is in desperate need of consistent mental health care and
    engaging in activities with kind-hearted people encouraging him in
    his healing process, step by step progress is being made. At this time it is difficult for him to leave the house so he
    gets isolated, he tends to get paranoid, depressed and fearful, then
    he doesn't want to leave the house. All the costs involved in his care are a bit difficult to
    manage, so we have decided to reach out and ask for help for him,
    and hope that collectively we can pull together and help him out so
    he can get the medical attention he needs to get better and thrive
    in life. How You Can Help If you want to make a donation one time or on an ongoing
    monthly basis of an amount that feels comfortable, it would be
    appreciated so very much at this time! We are aspiring to raise $300 a month on an ongoing basis or a
    total of $1800 to cover his costs for 6 months for his medication
    and in-home professional counseling costs in Costa Rica. The idea is that if everyone contributes a small amount
    monthly that this can be achieved. Monthly and one time donations can be sent on Paypal to yogaofbeauty@gmail.com If you have any questions in regards to setting up a monthly
    contribution please contact us directly at the above email address. There are also options on FundRazr to remain anonymous in
    making your donations. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help Nakula at
          this time and that we stand together as friends, and family
          near and far to help heal his PTSD. If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Nakula 's healing
        journey will be made so much easier by us all joining together
        to show how much we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations...",https://fundrazr.com/71RJb6

  participé, qui participent, et qui participeront a cette campagne de
  socio-financement. Bravo a vous tous, vous faîtes réellement une
  différence dans nos vies (surtout celle a Philip, mais aussi pour les
  gens qui l'entoure et qui s'inquiète). Près de 5,600$ ont été
  ramassé jusqu'à présent! Philip reprends du poil de la bête depuis les derniers traitement de
  chimiothérapie de cette hiver. Motivé , Philip cherche a réintégrer le
  marché du travail pour la saison estivale, afin de rester actifs et engagé. Un petit changement d'air s'impose, nous pourrons bientôt souhaiter
  la bienvenue a Philip, dans la capitale nationale ! _____________________________________________ Le 22 janvier 2019, Philip Simard-Léveillé, âgé de 21 ans, est
    diagnostiqué d’un cancer de l'hypopharynx de stade 3. Malgré la
    nouvelle, Philip garde la tête haute et les yeux pleins d’espoir; il
    est prêt à se battre. Pour ce type de cancer, les spécialistes
    estiment une durée de vie de 8 mois ainsi qu’un taux de réussite des
    traitements de chimiothérapie de 30%. Pour combattre la maladie,
    Philip a entamé ses traitements de chimiothérapie. Le type de
    traitement qu’il reçoit se fait par intraveineuse et la durée des
    traitements est de 12 heures par séance, toutes les deux semaines.
    Une fois une séance terminée, celui-ci doit immédiatement se
    retrouver en quarantaine dans un endroit aseptisé durant les 7 jours
    suivant le traitement. Suite à l’état difficile dans lequel les effets secondaires du
    traitement le laissaient, Philip a finalement pris la décision
    d’arrêter ses traitements, afin de profiter au maximum du précieux
    temps qu’il lui reste plutôt que de vivre alité et semi-conscient. Ayant perdu son travail dû au temps qu’il devait accorder à ses
    traitements et à son isolation, Philip doit toutefois continuer de
    manger et de payer son loyer et une inquiétude monétaire s’installe.
    Il est crucial pour la santé mentale de Philip de garder son
    indépendance, de rester autonome et d’avoir une vie active le plus
    longtemps possible. Une santé mentale forte est donc extrêmement
    importante afin qu’il puisse garder la tête haute. Positif, fonceur,
    travaillant, combatif et attentionné, Philip a besoin de votre aide
    afin de conserver son autonomie, mais aussi pour garder espoir. Les Fonds Les fonds que nous souhaitons recueillir pour aider Philip
    permettront de couvrir tous les besoins de base pour une période de
    12 mois: Loyer, hydro, nourriture, médicaments, déplacements,
    téléphone et Internet. Afin de conserver son autonomie ainsi qu’une
    vie active le plus longtemps possible, Philip a besoin d’amasser
    25,000$ afin de couvrir tous les frais et dépenses qui seront
    nécessaires au courant de l’année 2019. Une fois les frais de base
    couverts, Philip aura la chance de se concentrer sur sa ‘Bucket
    list’ et de vivre pleinement chaque instant. Vous pouvez aider Philip de plusieurs façons: - En apportant une contribution monétaire, peu importe le
    montant, afin de l’aider à rester autonome et ainsi lui donner une
    chance de surmonter la maladie, et de vivre ses rêves ; En partageant cette campagne à vos proches, ainsi que sur vos

      this campaign. All funds donated to this campaign go directly into
      Jesse and Greg's bank account only they have access to. Jessica Russman and I have been friends since we were kids.
      We are more like family. I can't remember a time when I've called
      upon her and she has not come through for me. Now SHE needs
      assistance, and I want within all my power to be at her aide. This
      one is going to take the Village though. Jesse was diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer several months
      ago and though a successful ablation the cancer was killed, due to
      other illnesses Jesse’s liver does not regenerate. Unfortunately
      she needs a full transplant before the cancer comes back. She is
      currently on the wait list and unable to work. It takes all the
      energy she can muster to spend quality time carrying for her
      beautiful 2 year old daughter Selena. Jesse’s husband Greg is an
      amazing man and has been her rock throughout all of this while
      maintaining all the financial and household responsibilities. Needless to say the medical bills are piling up and becoming
      insurmountable. The Russman’s need help to get over this mountain
      they are about to climb? Cancer is a wicked disease that gives no
      acknowledgement to age or personal circumstance. A liver
      transplant is Jesse's only hope of survival. Jesse and Greg live 90 miles away from the nearest hospital.
      So they have to stay in a hotel with Selena when Jesse has
      treatments.  When Jesse has her transplant she will be in the
      hospital for a month and then it will take 4 to 6 months of
      recovery at home. They will need some in home care for Selena and
      Jesse so Greg can work. Greg can take a leave from work to care
      for them, but he would have to go unpaid. Any help is appreciated.",https://fundrazr.com/JesseRussman

  have now classified as stage 4 colon cancer , Chris
  will be receiving follow-up chemotherapy treatment beginning March 27
  at City of Hope. During the first phase of treatment, a small spot on
  her liver grew to the size of a quarter. It was successfully excised
  in surgery, along with her gallbladder and approximately 13 inches of
  colon. But, due to the extremely aggressive nature of this cancer

    kind of help does not come easy for her. But, we have convinced her
    that relieving some of her financial burden will allow her to focus
    all of her energy on healing. Our goal is to raise funds to cover
    one year of medical and living expenses. We are hoping to raise funds to help her with medical co-pays;
    living expenses; integrative nutrition; ongoing expenses for her
    son, Eli; and complementary therapies that are not covered by insurance. Chris is a precious and inspiring friend to many, a true renaissance
  woman with extraordinary gifts to further bring to our world. We are
  inviting her friends, fans, and community to support her during this
  challenging time. We want her to know that we are here for her, as she

950,Help create balance on the planet through music,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,12,"Hi we're Ben & Cassie, founders of Soul Fit NYC, a wellness
  company dedicated to creativity, self expression and healing for all
  people on the planet. Early this year our friend Richard Miller, a brilliant Brazilian
  guitarist approached us about a concern and idea he had to solve it.
  He told us a little known fact: over 60% of professional musicians are
  forced to end their careers early due to injury. Richard knows that it
  doesn't have to be that way. Rather than feeling sorry for himself and
  those affected by injury, he took action. He created an idea for a
  healing retreat in the healing land of Costa Rica, especially for
  guitarists. It's called ""Balanced Guitar."" It's a retreat
  that addresses injury prevention through balance. With yoga, surging,
  Tai Chi, massage, guitar instruction and healing food, Richard knows
  he could make a difference. We loved the idea! Like Richard, Cassie and I saw the possibility of
  this retreat and the huge  impact and possitive benefits this retreat
  could have for anyone who participated (musicians or not). We hit the
  ground running and made Richards dream a reality. This January 5th-13th, Balanced Guitar will happen in the healing
  land of Nosara, Costa Rice. Students from all walks of life and
  economic backgrounds will study guitar technique from brilliant
  teachers like Freddie Bryant (Professional Guitarist, Professor at
  Berklee School of Music & Tai Chi instructor) & Richard Miller
  (professor at Columbia and Driectoe of Programming for the Afro-Latin
  Jazz Alliance in NYC). Iyengar Yoga will be taught by master teacher Rosa Santana. Thai
  Massage will be provided by Cassie Fireman. Surfing lessons will be
  taught by Richard Miller himself. Organic, home cooked meals will be
  cooked by local, Costa Rican chef: Robin. All this costs money and time. We have very little time remaining and
  we have more money to raise. We especially want to raise money to help
  send students to our retreat who can't afford it on their own. Please consider making a donation today. No amount is too small (or
  large) to make a difference. If if you or someone you know would like to attend the retreat, we
  have a few spots left. Check out our website at www.BalancedGuitar.com or email ben@soulfit.nyc for more information. Pura Vida, Ben & Cassie",https://fundrazr.com/815G31

"3,450",Please Help Marccelo!,U.S. Dollar,"Aug 16, 2019",of $30k goal,37,"My name is Guissela, and I'm the mother of a miraculous little boy. 
  As a mother of 2 boys with very different disabilities, there is
  nothing more terrible than seeing your child in pain over and over
  again. Well for me it was my 14-year-old son name Marccelo. After 2 spinal cord surgeries, we thought we missed the bullet
      when we were granted a miracle after a surgery that helped him get
      stronger and able to finally take his first steps with a gate
  trainer . But just like that our happy little hero's
  progress stopped.  When Marccelo started 8th grade, he suddenly began to get weaker and weaker and lost the ability
      to control his neck and lower extremities .  He also lost his spirited smile . I can still hear him asking me, ""Mommy what's going on? Why can’t I move my hands?"" I wish I could have given him a positive answer so he
  could have felt better knowing there was something we could do about
  it. Unfortunately, we got the sad news that he would need yet another
  spinal surgery; only this time it would have to be a spinal fusion and his life would be in
      jeopardy. Marccelo could lose the little strength he has left and
      be put on a ventilator for life. I am still praying
  for the courage to take that risk. Marccelo was born on November 22, 2004, the week of Thanksgiving. I
  was thankful to God for giving me such a beautiful blessing. I was
  beyond happy and felt I was the luckiest mother alive. On the day of
  his routine 9-month checkup, the doctor gave me the first of many bad
  news to come. Marccelo needed to be seen by a specialist due to the
  fact that he was very floppy. I took Marccelo for an MRI where I was
  told that he needed a spinal decompression. At only 13 months Marccelo
  had his first spinal surgery. Doctors told me he would never walk, speak, eat and that he
      would live his life permanently in a wheelchair. At
  that moment my world collapsed. I couldn't understand why this was
  happening to me. My faith was tested and I was angry at God for what
  he was doing to my child. It was the saddest day of my life. I gained strength and decided to give my son the best life I could .  I was on a mission to prove the doctors wrong. So as Marccelo grew up, I never treated him differently, nor did I
  make things easy for him. I wanted him to give it his all so he could
  become independent and succeed in life. At the age of 3, he was able to sit up, use his little hands to
      sign, speak with difficulties, eat on his own and do many things
      regular kids his age were doing. Of course, the
  walking part was a bit difficult. Regardless, Marccelo learned 2 languages, his letters, colors and numbers
      before he went to kindergarten. I was so proud, and
  happy for him. I knew there was something special about Marccelo that
  went beyond the fact he was my son. He always had an incredible way to touch hearts and inspire
  love. He is compassionate toward those suffering and has
  always been a peace maker.  This is why I believed him when he told me
  he had an encounter with God. In 2017, just before Marccelo’s second spinal decompression, he
      shared his story about a guardian angel coming to
  him.  He described his guardian angel and a message God shared with
  him about helping other children get to heaven.  He told me he met my
  grandmother who passed away 28 years before, telling me she had a
  message for me.  She called me by my pet name and said things about me
  and our relationship that Marccelo was not aware of.  I get goose
  bumps whenever I share his story.  After the experience, Marccelo went into his surgery full of faith and optimism
    with an unprecedented recovery in spite of what the doctors had told
    me to expect. That was why we thought we dodged a bullet. Marccelo has always been a kid who enjoys every second of the day, is
  outgoing, and still believes in his dream of becoming a famous video
  game player or cop!  Making sure everyone is happy, he consistently
  finds the best in the worst. He is so loving and supportive to his
  older brother who has autism...and to me, encouraging me when I would sometimes be brought to tears when
      my body would give out while trying to lift his chair into the
  car. My body, never my will, because I know I need to
  continue to be strong for him and his brother. There are no limits to what I would do to see my son smile
  again. The pain of watching him go through this is
  insurmountable.  I would take it all myself if it would lessen it for him. Today we face a bigger challenge. I am trying to ready myself and Marccelo for his third spinal
      cord decompression and fusion surgery. I am praying
  he will not have to be on a ventilator for the rest of his life, but I
  have to be prepared in case the doctors are right. I admit, it is
  overwhelming. Not just because money is a big issue but because time is running out and a lot of changes have to be made to make
      it all happen before his surgery. Following is a
  list of what we desperately need.  Fortunately, I was able to take a
  few things off the list because insurance is covering them.  Insurance
  is not covering the following: A wheelchair with a head array so Marccelo can move around independently,
        having the autonomy to continue to learn and have some fun
        playing games . An accessible mobility van because as he gets older, he is getting heavier. I can’t
        carry him anymore because it is not safe. We need a one level home with a room big enough for his medical bed, lift, and any
        other equipment he might need after surgery, also with an
        accessible bathroom so he can move around. Marccelo is not the only kid in need; we are not the only family in
  need. I'm only a very tiny percentage who are blessed to have come
  across a tremendous network of people who are encouraging me to take
  this step of reaching out to others for help. We a beyond grateful for anything you can give to help us get
      through this. A forever thankful mom, Guissela",https://fundrazr.com/Marccelo1122
"152,820",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,976,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33

  Syndrome. He needs total care for all of his needs and daily
  activities. He is now 74 pounds and getting so heavy for us to lift.
  We have sent a letter of medical necessity and applied twice for a
  lift to Ryan’s Medicaid but have been denied even after appealing. His
  12th birthday is coming up on June 21st and the only thing I can think
  of that he needs is a manual ceiling lift. This will help us safely
  get him from his bed to his wheelchair or to his bath chair. He has
  been getting bed baths for a year now despite having a rolling bath
  chair and a walk in shower to use because it is no longer safe for us
  to lift him especially when he is wet from the shower. He also goes
  many places throughout the week (church, therapy, and family outings)
  and we do not want him to be limited from these activities because we
  can no longer lift him and put him in his wheelchair. We do not want
  him to become bed bound. We have found a manual ceiling lift and track
  system at the lowest price possible that will meet his needs and have
  attached pictures. Thank you for sharing or story or donating to his

"26,060",Urgent Support Needed for Tony Dowling's Cancer Journey!,Australian Dollar,"Jul 1, 2019",of $60k goal,71,"Hi, my names Matt my wife and I have been friends with Tony and Tracy for nearly twenty
    years. They are a beautiful family and it was such a shock when I
    got the call from Tony recently telling me of his cancer diagnosis! I’m sure most of you have been following his journey as we have
    and are sending a constant stream of love, positive thoughts and
    prayers their way. I spoke again with Tony last week and heard the n ews of
    the new diagnosis and upgrade from stage 1 to stage 4. Truly heartbreaking to hear, but Tony is as positive and
    faith-filled as always, a true inspiration, we stand strong with
    them believing for a full recovery! He told me briefly of some of the struggles of dealing with the
    unexpected expenses and also the obvious loss of income etc. but
    expressed that he knows that God has it all under control and that he is confident of a positive outcome. After our chat I got off the phone and probably like many of you
    who are not physically located near Tony and Tracy in Sydney
    Australia, I thought to myself, there has to be something we can do to help, so I have set up this campaign in
    the hope that you will all join us in standing together to help make
    a massive difference to Tonys journey! Following is a snapshot of the Dowling family, a link to Tony’s
    journey so far which you can follow and the reasons why our
    donations are so very vital and impactful at this time for them... Tony is 46 years old and has been married to
  Tracy for 19 yrs. They live on the northern beaches of Sydney with
  their two boys Max 16 and Noah 14. The family is heavily involved in
  local basketball through the boy's school and the Manly representative
  level comps. Tracy is involved at the boy's school and helps
  co-ordinate and manage multiple basketball teams. Tony has a background as a school teacher,
  business entrepreneur and currently works in training and software
  development. They are active members of the local community, and
  church and love travelling, family time and adventures of any kind. Tony and Tracy have impacted the lives of so many people around the
  globe and locally with their big hearts and generous souls. We all have been positively influenced by this amazing couple in some
  shape or form, through either school, community, business or church
    life. Here is a link where you can follow Tony’s journey and progress: https://www.mylifeline.org/invitation/FOTY/b53c54fcc2abfed6f3d977439df0c4c309e98f36fff675b0772a480f52894be2 How we can help: Tony has just had surgery to remove bowel cancer which has also
  spread to his right lung. Tony’s diagnosis has now jumped from stage 1 to stage 4! This means that it is full steam ahead for aggressive chemotherapy
  treatment for the next 6 mths, followed by lung surgery around
  November 2019. They are in the process of trying to access some insurance funds, but
  there is a 3 mth waiting period that is not covered and then funds
  will still only cover 3/4 of normal income. On top of that, there are all the additional medical bills, hospital
  expenses, gap payments, medications and day to day additional expenses
  that come with this type of treatment... We want Tony, Tracy and the boys to be able to focus on the important
  things and keep any additional stress to a minimum. We would like to
  provide enough to get them through this 4 month transition period and
  also give them a buffer so that there is not a financial burden and
  pressure on them over the next 6 months. We would like to enable Tracy to not have to take up any additional
  work to cover any shortfall and added expenses, but be able to spend
  the time with Tony and attend to all the necessary appointments and
  give him all the required care and attention needed at this time. After calculating the amount needed to cover their everyday expenses
  keeping them afloat and to keep life as normal as possible, plus
  enough to help cover their ongoing medical costs for the next 6
  months, we have set a goal to raise $60K. Anything above that will go towards any additional ongoing medical
  expenses and treatment required. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless Tony
        and his family at this time as they link arms and stand together
        with friends, and family near and far to fight this nasty thing
        head on! If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Tony and His family’s journey will be
        made so much easier by us all joining together to show how much
        we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1TtQ0
"3,343",Mama Rose needs Hyperbaric Therapy.,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,29,"In October 2017, Rose Rios suffered from a stroke leaving her
  immobile and incapable of caring for herself. The results of the
  stroke caused Complex Regional Syndrome, Vascular Dementia, Aphasia
  and have severely shifted her life activities. Rose’s family is unable to fully provide the financial assistance to
  help her receive the care needed to get better, heal and get back the
  fun, vibrant colorful life she lived & felt just a year ago. Rose is surrounded by many friends and family who help take care of
  her around the clock but unfortunately with climbing medical bills
  from physical therapy, doctor’s visits, and the medication needed 2
  times a day- it’s getting more and more difficult. Update on Rose Rios 4.29.19 Rose was hospitalized 2 months ago & has digressed a bit, but is
  still stable. Her everyday routine continues to be a struggle with her
  waking up, using the restroom, eating, taking medicine and traveling
  to appointments. After seeing many specialist, they have concluded that hyperbaric
  oxygen treatments will help with her health and prolong her life. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a
  pressurized tube. The Hyperbaric chamber is used to treat stroke
  victims with significant results. The price for this is $1,920/mo, including an oxygen mask, plus a
  lift fee to place her in the chamber. The doctors would like to do
  this for 2-3months, to see if it substantially improves her recovery. Any donations, advice or help is truly appreciated to help us as we
  grasp for ways to help alleviate any amount of suffering and obstacles
  for Rose.",https://fundrazr.com/MamaRiosfundrazr.com
"16,670",Please help fund Aimee Kelso's treatment costs,U.S. Dollar,,of $30k goal,126,"For those of you that don't know me or know me well, three
      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Much love and blessings to you! aimee",https://fundrazr.com/aimeekelso
